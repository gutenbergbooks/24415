<h2>PROUD AND LAZY.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>Tommy Woggs was a funny little boy.
He was very proud and very lazy. He
seemed to think he was a great man, and
that other people lived only to serve and
obey him.</p>

<p>None of the boys and girls liked him,
because he used to order them round, and
because he thought himself so much better
than they were.</p>

<p>Tommy's father was a doctor, and a rich
man. He could afford to have servants to
wait upon his son, but he was not quite
rich enough to spoil the child by letting
him do as he pleased.</p>

<p>There are some things that wealth cannot
purchase. It will not buy wisdom, for all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
the money in the world would not teach a
person even to perform a simple question
in arithmetic.</p>

<p>It will not buy the love and respect of
others. Many rich men are hated and
despised by nearly all who know them.</p>

<p>So Tommy's father could not buy an
education for his son, nor would wealth
win for him the esteem of his companions.
He must study like the children of poor
people if he wanted to be wise; and he
must treat them well, in order to obtain
their good will.</p>

<p>Tommy did not like to study, and he did
like to command others. He wished every
body to think that he was better than they,
because he had been to New York, and
because his father was rich.</p>

<p>Children are just like men and women.
They always find out the really good boys
and girls, and love and respect them. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
they never think much of those who think
too much of themselves.</p>

<p>When Tommy was eight years old, his
father sent him to the village school. It
was a public school, and it was the best in
the town. He had learned his letters at
home, and was able to read a very little.</p>

<p>At first he was pleased with the idea of
going to school, and did not even tell his
mother he would not go. He was very apt
to say he would not do anything, when he
was told to do it.</p>

<p>I am sorry to add that his parents were
very much to blame, for he was an only
child, and they did not like to cross him.
They did not make him "mind," as all
good parents ought to do, and as all good
children are willing to do. He used to have
his own way; and when he went to school,
he hardly knew what it was to obey.</p>

<p>Miss Dale, the teacher, gave him a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
seat, when he first went to school, and spoke
very kindly to him. For two or three days
he got along quite well. It was a new thing
to him, and he was pleased with the school
and the teacher.</p>

<p>But in a little while he was tired of the
place, and of the teacher, and he had yet
to learn that he could not always have his
own way.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of his school-life, when
Miss Dale called him up to read, he made
up his mind that he would not read.</p>

<p>"I don't want to read," said he.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't, Thomas. Do you
know what your father sends you to school
for?" replied Miss Dale.</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"You must not speak so to me. Come
here."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"Don't be naughty, Thomas. I asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
you to come to me."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"If you won't come, I shall bring you."</p>

<p>Tommy didn't exactly know what to make
of this; but the teacher did not give him
much time to think about it, for she took
him by the collar of his coat, and, in spite of
his kicking and screaming, dragged him up
to the desk.</p>

<p>"Now, stand there, Thomas; and if you
are a good boy, and obey me, I will not hurt
you at all."</p>

<p>"I won't be a good boy," growled
Tommy; and when Miss Dale let go of him,
he threw himself on the floor and began to
kick and scream as though he had been mad.</p>

<p>The teacher opened her desk, and took
out a little stick. Tommy did not like the
looks of the stick, but he kept on kicking
and screaming.</p>

<p>"Get up, Thomas," said Miss Dale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't," screamed Tommy, very loud.</p>

<p>"Won't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>"Then I shall whip you."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," yelled Tommy.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. Miss Dale would
and did whip him, till he was glad to get
up. He found the little stick was a thing
not to be trifled with, for it made him smart
so he could not bear the pain.</p>

<p>"I'm going home," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Thomas."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"I think not. Now, pick up your book,
and be a good boy."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>Then a smart cut of the stick upon one of
his legs made him scream with pain again.</p>

<p>"Pick up your book, now, Thomas."</p>

<p>"I'll tell my mother of you," snarled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
Tommy, as he picked up the book.</p>

<p>"You may, if you choose. Now open your
book."</p>

<p>He did not mind, and again he felt the
terrible stick, which caused him to obey.</p>

<p>"Now, Thomas," said Miss Dale, as she
put the stick in the desk, "when I tell you
to do anything, you must obey me."</p>

<p>"I won't, either."</p>

<p>"You must not say you won't to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>The teacher opened the desk and took out
the stick again.</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>Tommy felt the stick once more; and this
time blow followed blow till Tommy, of his
own accord, promised not to use the naughty
words again.</p>

<p>"Now, Thomas, if you will be a good boy
you will not have any more trouble. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
must do what I tell you to do, and not be
saucy to me."</p>

<p>"I'll tell my mother of you. She don't
whip me," muttered Tommy.</p>

<p>"You may tell your mother, and if she
does not wish you to mind, she must not
send you here. But I think she wants you
to be a good boy, obey your teacher, and
get your lessons."</p>

<p>"No, she don't," said Tommy, who was
not quite willing to be good yet.</p>

<p>"Well, it does not make any difference
whether she does or not; you must mind all
I say if you come to school here."</p>

<p>Miss Dale then heard him read; but he did
not do very well. He was thinking all the
time what he could do that was naughty;
but as he kept one eye on the little stick, he
did not venture again to disobey or to be
saucy.</p>

<p>When he went home that day he told his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
mother he was not going to school any more;
and perhaps she would have let him have
his own way. But his father, when he heard
what Miss Dale had done, said he was glad
she had made him mind, and that he should
go to school in the afternoon.</p>

<span class="caption">Tommy makes a mistake.</span>
</div>

<p>To make the matter sure, Dr. Woggs went
to school with him himself, and told the
teacher to make a good boy of him, if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
could, and above all things to make him
obey her. So Tommy got the worst of it,
after all.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>


<p>Tommy Woggs learned to obey while he
was in school. That little stick produced a
great change in him; but after the first
week, Miss Dale did not have occasion to
use it again.</p>

<p>He found that he must mind, and he had
sense sufficient to see that it was just as
easy to obey before he was whipped, or even
scolded, as it was afterwards.</p>

<p>It was the next year after Tommy began
to go to school that he went to New
York. It was a great thing for a little boy
like him to go away so far, and see so many
wonderful things; and his companions, for
a time, thought he was a real hero.</p>

<p>When he came back he told ever so many
stories of what he had seen&mdash;of the fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
buildings in New York, of the great crowds
of people in Broadway, and the sights he
saw at the Museum.</p>

<p>But the children soon grew tired of it,
and did not want to hear any more of
Tommy's stories. I think it quite likely
that, if Tommy had not been so smart about
it, they would have been glad to hear a great
deal more about New York.</p>

<p>But I have another story to tell about
Tommy; and I hope it will convince all my
young readers that it is better to obey their
parents, even if they are not punished, than
it is to disregard what they tell them.</p>

<p>I have said that Tommy was proud and
lazy. He was so proud he did not like to
mind; and so lazy that he did not like to
go to school, because he had to study there,
and learn his lessons.</p>

<p>One fine morning in June, when the birds
were singing on all the trees, and the grass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
looked bright and green on the hills, Tommy
left his father's house to go to school.</p>

<p>He did not want to go to school that day.
He told his mother it was too pleasant to be
shut up in a school room all day, and he
begged that he might be permitted to stay
at home.</p>

<p>"No, Tommy, you must go to school.
Your father says that you must not stay at
home a single day, unless you are sick."</p>

<p>This was about an hour before school
time, and the lazy boy sat on the door stone,
for a while, and then came back and told
his mother he did not feel very well.</p>

<p>"What ails you, Tommy?" asked his
mother.</p>

<p>"I'm sick."</p>

<p>"Not very sick, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am; real sick."</p>

<p>Just then his father came in, and heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
his complaint.</p>

<p>"How long have you felt sick, Tommy?"
asked his father.</p>

<p>"Ever since I got up," replied Tommy,
placing his hand upon his stomach.</p>

<p>"You ate your breakfast very well for
a sick boy."</p>

<p>"I feel worse since I ate my breakfast,"
said the little boy, trying very hard to look
sick.</p>

<p>"What ails you?"</p>

<p>"I feel sick at the stomach."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you will feel better by and
by," added Dr. Woggs.</p>

<p>"But I can't go to school, father."</p>

<p>"O, you can't?" said his father, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I don't feel able to go."</p>

<p>"Then you needn't go."</p>

<p>Tommy was much pleased to find he had
gained his point; and he did not think of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
the wicked lies he had told. His father said
he might stay away from school that day,
and this was all he wanted.</p>

<p>He had a pair of rabbits in the wood shed,
and without thinking that he was sick, he
was going out to play with them.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Tommy?" asked
his father.</p>

<p>"Out in the wood shed to see my rabbits."</p>

<p>"I thought you were sick."</p>

<p>"So I am, father."</p>

<p>"Then sit down on the sofa, and I will
attend to you in a moment. Do you feel
very sick?"</p>

<p>"I'm real bad, father," replied Tommy,
quickly, for he was afraid his father would
send him to school, after all.</p>

<p>Dr. Woggs opened a drawer in his bookcase,
and took out a little jar, filled with a
kind of yellow powder. He then asked Mrs.
Woggs to get him a little molasses in a cup,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
and a teaspoon.</p>

<p>Tommy turned pale then, for he knew all
about that powder in the little jar.</p>

<p>"Now, my son, we will make you well by
to-morrow, so that you will be able to go
to school again," said Dr. Woggs, as he
took the cover off the jar.</p>

<p>Tommy began to cry, for he would rather
have taken a whipping than a dose of that
nasty, yellow powder.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tommy? Do you
feel worse?" asked his father.</p>

<p>"I don't want to take any of that stuff,"
whined the poor little invalid.</p>

<p>"I know, Tommy, it isn't pleasant to
take; but when we are sick, we must take
something to keep us from getting any
worse."</p>

<p>"I don't want to take it, father. It
always <ins title="Inserted word 'makes'">makes</ins> me a good deal sicker than I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
before&mdash;it does indeed, father."</p>

<p>"That's very true, my boy; but, for all
that, you must take it. We very often have
to make folks worse before they can be any
better. It always hurts to set a broken
arm or leg; but no one would think of
letting it remain unset because the operation
is painful."</p>

<p>His mother soon came with the cup of
molasses, and Dr. Woggs put some of the
yellow powder into it, and stirred up the
mixture.</p>

<p>"I don't want to take it, father," cried
Tommy, who was trembling with dread at
the very thought of the nasty stuff.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, my boy. You must take
it," said the doctor, in such a tone that the
poor boy felt he must obey, or confess that
he had told a falsehood.</p>

<p>"I can't take it, father," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! I know it is not good; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
only think how sick you are! Why, you are
so bad that you cannot go to school."</p>

<p>"I will go to school," whined Tommy.</p>

<p>"What! when you are sick?" asked his
father. "O, no; you must not go to school
when you are sick; it is a bad place for
sick boys. Take the medicine, stay at home
and get well."</p>

<p>"I will go to school," repeated Tommy,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Not when you are sick, my son."</p>

<p>"I'm not sick, father."</p>

<p>"Not sick!"</p>

<p>"No, father."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say only a few moments since
that you were sick&mdash;real bad?"</p>

<p>"But I am much better now; and I think
I am able to go to school."</p>

<p>"You may be sick again, my son."</p>

<p>"I shall not, father; I know I shall not."</p>

<p>"I think you had better take the medicine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
to prevent another attack."</p>

<p>"No, father; I wasn't sick at all," said the
little boy, very sheepishly.</p>

<p>Dr. Woggs scolded him in a most severe
manner for the falsehood he had uttered,
and then sent him to school. He ought to
have remembered this lesson. It was the
last time that Tommy ever pretended he was
sick, as that disgusting yellow powder frequently
showed itself to his imagination.</p>

<p>I don't think it would answer for many
parents to do as Tommy's father did; but
he was a doctor, and understood the case.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p>It was a beautiful morning in June when
Tommy Woggs left his home to go to school,
after the events which I have related in the
last chapter.</p>

<p>He did not want to go to school&mdash;of course
he did not, or he would not have pretended
to be sick, that he might stay at home. The
grass looked so green, and the birds sang
so sweetly, that he wished to have a good
time with them in the fields.</p>

<p>If he had been a good boy, and had always
done his duty in school, he would not have
felt so; and he was just as much to blame
for feeling wrong as he was for doing wrong.</p>

<p>I have always noticed that children who
behave well, and get their lessons, like to
be in school. It is a pleasant place to them.
And doing right always makes us happy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
wherever we are.</p>

<p>But those who are naughty, and neglect
their duties, are always in trouble; and for
this reason they hate school. It is their
own fault, however, that they dislike it, for
if they did right, they would be happy not
only there, but everywhere else.</p>

<p>Tommy dragged along the street like a
snail, or like a sheep led to the slaughter.
When he got about half way to the school
house, he met Joe Birch and Ben Tinker.</p>

<p>My readers already know Joe Birch, and
know that he was a bad boy; and I suppose,
after being told that Ben Tinker was his
constant companion, they can easily guess
what kind of a boy he was. They were very
much alike, and were the leaders in all the
mischief done in Riverdale.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Tommy?" asked
Ben.</p>

<p>"I am going to school," he replied, stopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
to talk with the two boys, who were
seated on a rock at the side of the road.</p>

<p>"Have you got any money, Tom?" said
Joe.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't."</p>

<p>"'Cause, if you've got three cents about
you, I will tell you something."</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Tommy, without
thinking of the price which the bad boy
asked for his important information.</p>

<p>"That's telling," replied Joe, winking at
his companion.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Give me three cents, and I will."</p>

<p>"I haven't got three cents; but I will give
them to you some time."</p>

<p>"I won't trust you. Give me the money
now, and I will tell you all about it," added
Joe.</p>

<p>"How can I give it to you when I haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
got it?"</p>

<p>The two bad boys saw that he was willing
enough to pay them for what they had to
tell him, and they had only to devise a plan
by which he could raise the funds.</p>

<p>"Are you going to school, Tom?" asked
Joe Birch.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Because my father makes me go. I tried
to get off this morning. I made believe
sick; but father was going to make me take
some of his nasty physic, and I thought I'd
rather go to school than do that."</p>

<p>"I can tell you how you can stay away
from school without taking any physic."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Give me the three cents, and I will tell
you."</p>

<p>"I haven't them; if I had I would."</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you how to get them, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
you like."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Go home to your mother, and tell her
the schoolma'am sent you home for three
cents to buy a new book."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," replied Tommy, not stopping
to think how wicked was the act which
the bad boy proposed to him.</p>

<p>"Mind you, Tom, go to your mother&mdash;don't
go to your father."</p>

<p>Tommy promised to do just as he was
told by these bad boys, and ran home with
all his might, to get the money for them.
His mother did not stop to ask him any questions,
though she wondered what book he
could buy for three cents.</p>

<p>"Here's the three cents," said Tommy, as
he joined the boys in the road. "Now tell
me how I can stay away from school without
having to take any physic."</p>

<p>"Just come with us; we are not going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
to school this fine morning. When the factory
bell rings for twelve o'clock, just go
home; and your folks won't know but that
you have been to school."</p>

<p>"That's the way," added Ben Tinker.
"That's what the fellers call 'hookin'
jack.'"</p>

<p>Tommy did not exactly like the idea at
first, for he could not help thinking what
might happen in case he got found out.
He did not ask himself whether it was
right or wrong to do what the boys called
"hooking jack;" but only whether he should
get found out or not.</p>

<p>We ought always to do right, whatever
may happen to us; and we should never
do wrong, even if we feel certain of not
being found out.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Over the other side of the river. We
must not let any one see us after school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
time, for they will know we ought to be in
school."</p>

<p>"And, just you mind, Tom Woggs," added
Ben, "if you get found out yourself, you
mustn't tell of us. If you do, you will be
apt to get a broken head&mdash;mind that."</p>

<p>Joe Birch jumped over the wall into the
lot, and was followed by his companions in
evil. Tommy did not feel just right; not
that he felt bad because he was doing wrong,
but because he was afraid of the two boys.</p>

<p>When they had crossed the lot, they came
to a by-road; and here it was agreed that
Ben should run up to the village and buy
something with the money which Tommy
had furnished.</p>

<p>He was gone but a little while; and when
he joined them again, they all hastened
across the bridge, and were soon in the
woods, where no one could see them.</p>

<p>"What did you buy with the money?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Some cigars. I got six for three cents."</p>

<p>"Cigars!" exclaimed Tommy. "What
do you want of cigars?"</p>

<p>"To smoke, of course. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"It will make you sick."</p>

<p>"I guess not. You shall have one, if
you like. A feller ain't nobody if he don't
smoke," replied Joe.</p>

<p>But the boys decided not to smoke at
first; and seeing there was plenty of sticks
and brush in the woods, Tommy proposed
that they should build a house&mdash;just for the
fun of it.</p>

<p>"So we will; and when we get it done, we
will smoke our cigars in it, and have a good
time," replied Ben.</p>

<p>"That will be first rate," added Joe.
"But how are you going to build it?"</p>

<p>"O, I know how. I have been to New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
York, and I know all about these things,"
said Tommy, beginning now to show his
usual vanity.</p>

<p>"I say, Tom, do they make houses out of
brush in New York?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"No; but then I have been about more
than you have, and I ought to know more,
of course. I will be the builder, and you
two shall be my servants."</p>

<p>"Look here, Tom&mdash;none of that talk, my
boy. We ain't your servants, any how," said
Joe.</p>

<p>"Never mind him, Joe," added Ben.
"Let him build the house, if he can. I wonder
what it will look like!"</p>

<p>"Well, you bring me the sticks and brush,
and see if I don't build a good one," replied
Tommy.</p>

<p>The two boys agreed to this plan; and in a
little while they had a great pile of sticks
and brush, and Tommy began to build the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
house. He stuck up two sticks, like the
letter V, and then carried a long pole from
the top of them down to the ground.
Against the pole, he set up long sticks; and
then told his companions to cover them over
with brush and leaves.</p>

<p>It did not take a very long time to build
such a house as this, and it was soon finished.
The boys were much pleased with it,
and seated themselves on the ground, inside
of it, for the purpose of having a good time.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>It was now after eleven o'clock, and it
would soon be time for the truants to return
home.</p>

<p>The hut which they had built was not
very tight, but it kept the sun out; and the
boys were so well pleased with it that they
agreed to come there again in the afternoon.
They wished the forenoon had been
much longer, for their fun came to an end
too soon.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, we will have a smoke," said
Joe, as they seated themselves in the house.</p>

<p>"Yes; and we haven't any too much time,"
replied Ben Tinker, as he took the cigars
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Have you any matches?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I have. What's the use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
cigars without any matches? Take a cigar,
Tom."</p>

<p>Tommy took the cigar, and though he had
some doubts about smoking it, he did not
like to be behind his companions in anything.
He thought it would make him sick,
as he had known it to do to others. He did
not want to smoke it, but he had not the
courage to refuse.</p>

<p>He was proud, and did not want to have
the other boys any smarter than he was.
They thought it was manly and big to smoke,
for I don't believe either of them could have
liked the fumes of a cigar. They had not
smoked enough for this.</p>

<p>Ben lighted a match, and then his cigar.
Joe, as dignified as any old smoker, took a
light from him; and both of them puffed
away, and felt as big as though they were
doing some great thing.</p>

<p>"Have a light, Tommy?" asked Ben.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
"If you are going with us, you must learn
to smoke."</p>

<p>"All the fellers that are anything smoke,"
added Joe.</p>

<p>"Then I'll smoke," replied Tommy. "I
used to see lots of gentlemen smoking cigars
in Broadway, in New York, when I was
there."</p>

<p>"Of course you did."</p>

<p>Tommy put the cigar into his mouth; he
did not like the taste of the thing, but he
felt that it was a good cause, and he was
willing to be a martyr. Ben lent him his
cigar to light it by; and with a little instruction
from his friends, he was soon able
to puff away as smart as any of them.</p>

<p>It was not half so bad as he had feared it
would be. It did not make him sick, at
first, and he thought he was one of that kind
who can smoke without learning.</p>

<p>He felt as big as his companions then, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
the wrong idea that smoking was smart had
taken full possession of him.</p>

<p>There are some savages who paint their
faces&mdash;they think it is smart; we don't
think so. Some Indians wear bits of tin
fastened to the ends of their noses&mdash;they
think it looks pretty; we don't think so.</p>

<p>It does not follow, therefore, that every
thing that looks smart is so. A little boy,
or any boy, with a cigar in his mouth, is a
disgusting sight to sensible people. We
never heard of any man who thought it was
smart for boys to smoke, or to make use of
tobacco in any way.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, tell us something about New
York while we are smoking," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Well, I will, if you wish me to do so;
but I have got almost tired of talking about
New York. Everybody wants to know
what I saw there."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"Do they?" laughed Joe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I don't like to say no to them, for
I am willing to help along those who don't
know as much as I do."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say we don't know as
much as you do?" demanded Ben, angrily.</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't been to New York&mdash;have
you?"</p>

<p>"What if we haven't?"</p>

<p>"Then, of course, you can't know so much
as I do. I was there a week."</p>

<p>"If you say that again, I'll pound you,"
said Ben, rising.</p>

<p>"There's a stump for you, Tom," added
Joe.</p>

<p>Tommy had not a great deal of courage;
but, in a little while, Joe Birch managed to
get up a fight between his little companions.
He showed Tommy how to strike; and the
two boys went into the matter like real
bruisers.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The fight in the woods.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Of course, Tommy Woggs got whipped&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
it served him just right. His face was
scratched, and one of his eyes was very red.
Just then he thought he should not tell
another boy that he did not know as much
as he did.</p>

<p>The quarrel was soon made up; for after
Ben Tinker had thrashed the little boaster
he was satisfied, and Tommy did not dare to
be cross. By this time they had to start for
home.</p>

<p>Tommy had not got half way to his
father's house before he began to feel dizzy,
and to realize a very unpleasant feeling at
the stomach. But he hurried home as fast
as he could, which was not very fast, for he
was sick in earnest now.</p>

<p>He staggered into the parlor, where his
mother was sewing. He felt very bad then,
and wished, with all his heart, that he had
gone to school, and kept away from the bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
boys.</p>

<p>"I feel sick, mother," said Tommy, as he
threw himself into a chair.</p>

<p>"Why, Tommy! You are as pale as a
ghost," exclaimed his mother, looking up
from her work. "What ails you?"</p>

<p>"I feel sick at the stomach. I want to go
to bed."</p>

<p>Whatever were the doubts Mrs. Woggs
had in the morning about her son's sickness,
she had none now. His pale face and blue
lips were evidences of his condition.</p>

<p>Taking him by the hand, she led him upstairs,
and put him into bed. Then she
called Dr. Woggs, who was in his library, to
come upstairs and see him.</p>

<p>"Poor boy; he is real sick," said his
mother, as the doctor entered the room.
"He is just as pale as death, and could
hardly walk upstairs."</p>

<p>"What ails him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is sick at the stomach, just as he was
this morning. It was too bad to send him to
school when he felt so sick. I knew he was
ill then."</p>

<p>"He wasn't very bad this morning," said
the doctor, who did not know what to make
of it.</p>

<p>"He was real sick then, and I knew he
was. It was too bad to make him go to
school," added the fond mother.</p>

<p>"But I didn't make him go to school,"
replied Dr. Woggs. "I was only going to
give him some medicine to make him
better."</p>

<p>The cigar had done its work; and it
operated upon him just as that nasty yellow
powder would if he had taken it.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the doctor, after the
contents of Tommy's stomach had been
thrown up. "What have you been doing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, father," replied Tommy,
faintly.</p>

<p>"You have been smoking. You smell as
strong of tobacco smoke as a bar-room
loafer."</p>

<p>"Smoking!" exclaimed Mrs. Woggs, with
horror.</p>

<p>"Have you been smoking, Tommy?"
asked his father sternly.</p>

<p>The poor sufferer felt so bad, he had no
courage to tell a lie, and he was obliged to
own that he had been smoking.</p>

<p>When he felt a little better, his father
questioned him so closely, that in spite of his
promise, Tommy had to say he had "hooked
jack" that forenoon, and that he had been
in the woods with Joe and Ben, where each
of them had smoked a cigar.</p>

<p>Dr. Woggs went to the school that afternoon,
and told Miss Dale all about it; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
then to the parents of Joe and Ben, and told
them all about it. The truants were all
punished; and as the schoolmistress promised
to send word to their homes when either
of them was absent again, they had no
chance to "hook jack" afterwards.</p>

<p>Tommy was as well as ever the next day;
but that red eye became a black eye, and the
children laughed at him for a week.</p>

<p>He thought how much trouble he had
caused himself by being proud and lazy, and
he resolved to be a better boy. He did very
well for some time; he went to school without
complaining, and didn't talk big; but he
was not entirely cured.</p>

<p>It often takes a great while to get rid of
bad habits; but we should banish them, even
if it takes a whole lifetime to do so.</p>

<h2>CARELESS KATE.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>"Kate!" said Mrs. Lamb to her daughter,
who was playing in the garden, in front
of the house.</p>

<p>"What do you want, mother?" replied
the little girl, without even lifting her eyes
from the ground, in which she was planting
a marigold.</p>

<p>I don't think any of my young readers regard
this as a proper answer for a little girl
to make to her mother; and I hope none of
them ever speak to their parents in this
manner.</p>

<p>"Come into the house. I want you,"
added her mother.</p>

<p>But Kate did not go till she got ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
She was not in the habit of minding her
mother at once, and without asking any improper
questions, as all good children do,
or ought to do, at least.</p>

<p>When she stepped out of the bed of
flowers, in which she had been at work, instead
of looking to see where she put her
feet, she kept her eyes fixed on the place
where she had just planted the marigold.</p>

<p>"Look before you leap" is a good motto
for everybody&mdash;for children, as well as for
men and women. If Kate had thought of it,
perhaps she would have saved herself and
her mother a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>She did not mind where she stepped, and
put her foot upon a beautiful, sweet-scented
peony, which had just come out of the
ground. She broke the stem short off, and
crushed the root all in pieces.</p>

<p>Now, this flower was very highly prized
by Mrs. Lamb, for she had brought it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
a great distance, and it was the only one of
the kind in Riverdale at that time.</p>

<p>Kate was very fond of flowers herself, and
when she saw the mischief she had done, she
cried with anger and vexation. She would
not have spoiled this peony for a great deal,
for she had looked forward with much pleasure
to the time when it should bud and
blossom, and fill the garden with its fragrance.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Kate?"
called her mother, from the house, when she
heard Kate crying.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to do it, mother," sobbed
the poor girl.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to do what, Kate?" said
her mother, rushing into the garden to find
out what mischief had been done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb was very angry when she saw
that the peony was spoiled; and she took
Kate by the arm, and shook her. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
think this shaking did any good; but it was
a great trial to her to see her favorite flower
destroyed.</p>

<p>"You careless girl!" said Mrs. Lamb.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to, mother," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"But you were careless, as you always
are. Will you never learn to be careful?
You walk about the flower beds as though
they were solid rocks."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to tread upon it," was
all that poor Kate could say.</p>

<p>It was very true that she did not mean to
spoil the peony; but it was almost as bad to
ruin it by being careless. Children ought
to understand that not meaning to do wrong
is not a good excuse, when the wrong might
have been prevented by being careful.</p>

<p>Suppose the captain of a ship should run
his vessel on the rocks, and lose a dozen
lives, by being careless; do you think people
would be willing to trust him with another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
vessel afterwards?</p>

<p>Suppose the engineer should neglect to
keep watch of the boiler, and it should burst;
would not people blame him? Would they
think it a good excuse if he said he did not
mean to let it burst?</p>

<p>If the man who has the keeping of a
powder house should smoke a pipe in it, and
twenty persons should be killed by his carelessness,
do you think it would be enough for
him to say he did not intend to kill them?</p>

<p>When we go on the water in a sailing
vessel or a steamer; when we ride on a railroad,
in a stage, or wagon, our lives depend
on the carefulness with which the vessel,
railroad, or carriage is managed. People
don't excuse them, when lives are lost, because
they did not mean to kill anybody.</p>

<p>You are liable to lose your life every day
by the carelessness of some one. The house
in which you are to sleep on a cold winter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
night may be burned down by the neglect of
those who take care of the fires.</p>

<p>The careless use of a lamp might destroy
many lives and much property. If you play
with fire, though you do not mean any harm,
you may burn the house in which you live,
and perhaps destroy the lives of your
friends.</p>

<p>A little carelessness may produce dreadful
results. The want of thought for a few
moments may do more mischief than you
can repair in a whole lifetime.</p>

<p>Kate Lamb was not a bad girl at heart.
She loved her parents and her friends as
much as any little girl; but she often gave
them a great deal of trouble and sadness by
her carelessness.</p>

<p>She was so thoughtless that she had come
to be called "Careless Kate." It was a bad
fault; and it sometimes led her to commit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
worse ones, as my story will show.</p>

<p>"Now, Kate, come into the house; and
next time, when I call, come at once," said
her mother. "If you had minded me, perhaps
my flower would not have been
spoiled."</p>

<p>"I will be more careful next time,
mother," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"I hope you will. I think you have done
sufficient mischief by being careless, and I
hope you will soon begin to do better."</p>

<p>"I will try, mother."</p>

<p>Very likely she meant to try, just then,
while she was smarting under her mother's
rebuke, and while she was still sad at the
loss of the flower; but she had promised to
do better so many times, that her mother
could hardly believe her again.</p>

<p>"I want you to carry this quart of milk
down in the meadow to poor Mrs. O'Brien,"
said Mrs. Lamb, as she handed her a tin kettle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
"And you must go quick, for it is
almost dark now."</p>

<p>"It won't take me long, mother."</p>

<p>"But you must be very careful, and not
spill any of the milk."</p>

<p>"I will be very careful."</p>

<p>"Mrs. O'Brien is sick, and has two small
children. This milk is for their supper."</p>

<p>"That is the woman whose husband was
killed on the railroad last summer&mdash;isn't it,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and she is very poor. She is sick
now, and not able to work. The neighbors
have all sent milk to her for her children,
and a great many other things. Now go
just as fast as you can, but be very careful
and not spill the milk."</p>

<h3>II.</h3>


<p>Kate put on her bonnet, and taking the
pail of milk, hastened towards the house
of the poor sick woman. But she had gone
but a little way when she met Fanny Flynn,
who was an idle girl, and very fond of mischief.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Kate?" asked
Fanny.</p>

<p>"I am going down to Mrs. O'Brien's with
some milk."</p>

<p>"Give me a drink&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"I can't; it is for the poor widow's
children. I suppose they won't have any
supper till they get this milk."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will. I won't drink but a
little of it."</p>

<p>"No, I can't give you any. It would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
be right for me to do so."</p>

<p>"Pooh! You needn't pretend to be so
good all at once. You are no better than I
am."</p>

<p>"I didn't say I was. Only I shall not
give you any of this milk, when it is for the
poor woman's children; so you needn't ask
me," replied Kate, with a great deal of
spirit.</p>

<p>Some people think, when they do anything
that is right, they ought to make a
great parade over it; but this only shows
that they are not much in the habit of doing
right, and they wish to get all the credit
they can for it.</p>

<p>It was so with Kate. She ought to have
been content with merely doing her duty,
without "talking large" about it. Fanny
felt that she was just as good as Kate, and
she was angry when the latter made a needless
show of her intention to do what she
believed to be right.</p>

<img src="images/ill-067tn.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="Fanny and Kate." title="Fanny and Kate." />
<span class="caption">Fanny and Kate.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"I don't want it," said Fanny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you ask me for it for, then?
You wanted to make me do something that
was wrong."</p>

<p>"You are not always so nice," sneered
Fanny.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to do wrong, anyhow, as
some folks do."</p>

<p>"Do you mean me?"</p>

<p>"No matter whom I mean."</p>

<p>Fanny was so angry that she walked up
to Kate and pulled her "shaker" down over
her face. She also used some naughty
words when she did so, which I will not repeat.</p>

<p>Kate, in her turn, was very angry with
the saucy girl, and wanted to "pay" her
for what she had done. But Fanny did not
wait for any reply, and ran away just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
fast as she could.</p>

<p>It would have been much better for Kate
if she had let her go; but she was so angry
she could not do this; she wanted to strike
back again. Without thinking of the milk
in the pail, she started to run after the
naughty girl.</p>

<p>For a few moments she ran with all her
might, and had nearly caught Fanny, when
a stone tripped her up, and she fell upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Then she thought of the milk, and tried to
save it; but the cover of the kettle came off,
and it was all spilled on the ground.</p>

<p>The fall did not hurt her, but the laugh
with which her misfortune was greeted by
Fanny roused a very wicked spirit in her
heart, and dropping the pail, which she had
picked up, she pursued her.</p>

<p>But the naughty girl had the start of her,
and though she followed her a good way she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
could not overtake her. Then she stopped
in the path, and cried with anger and vexation.
The thought of the milk which had
been spilled, was, after all, the worst part
of the affair.</p>

<p>Walking back to the place where the accident
had happened, she picked up the pail
again, and began to think what she should
do. It was of no use now for her to go to
Mrs. O'Brien's. She had no milk for the
children's supper.</p>

<p>What would her mother say to her if she
should return home and tell her she had
spilled all the milk? She had told her to
be careful, and she felt that she had been
very careless.</p>

<p>It was not necessary that she should chase
the naughty girl, whatever she said; and
she could not help seeing that she had been
very careless. While she was thinking
about it, Ben Tinker came along. He lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
in the next house to Mr. Lamb, and the children
were well acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Kate?"
asked Ben, when he saw that her eyes were
red, and her face was wet with tears.</p>

<p><ins title="Added missing quote">"I</ins> have just spilled a pailful of milk on the
ground," sobbed Kate.</p>

<p>"O, well, it's no use to cry for spilled
milk," laughed Ben.</p>

<p>"I was carrying it to Mrs. O'Brien."</p>

<p>"No matter; she will get along very well
without it."</p>

<p>"That ugly Fanny Flynn struck me on
the head, and that's what made me spill the
milk."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hit her back?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't catch her; she ran away. I
was chasing her when I fell down and
spilled the milk."</p>

<p>"You can catch her some time; when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
do, give it to her."</p>

<p>But Kate had got over her anger, and
heartily wished she had not attempted to
catch Fanny. Besides, she very well knew
that Ben was giving her bad advice.</p>

<p>That passage from the New Testament,
"If any man smite thee on the one cheek,
turn to him the other also," came to her
mind, and she felt how wicked it was to harbor
a desire for revenge.</p>

<p>The loss of the milk, and what would
follow when she went home, gave her more
trouble than the injury she had received
from the naughty girl.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I shall do," said she,
beginning to cry again, as she thought of her
mother.</p>

<p>"Do? you can't do anything&mdash;can you?
The milk is gone, and all you have to do is
to go home," replied Ben.</p>

<p>"What will my mother say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span></p>

<p>"No matter what she says, if she don't
whip you or send you to bed without your
supper."</p>

<p>"She won't whip me, and I have been to
supper."</p>

<p>"Then what are you crying about?"</p>

<p>"Mother says I am very careless; and I
know I am," whined Kate.</p>

<p>"Don't be a baby, Kate."</p>

<p>"I spoiled a flower this afternoon, and
mother scolded me and shook me for it. She
told me to be very careful with this milk,
and now I have spilled the whole of it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you feel so bad, why need you
tell her anything about it?"</p>

<p>"About what?" asked Kate, looking up
into his face, for she did not quite understand
him.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell her you spilled the
milk. She will never find it out."</p>

<p>"But she will ask me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span></p>

<p>"What if she does? Can't you tell her
you gave the milk to the old woman, and
that she was very much obliged to her for
sending it?"</p>

<p>"I can do that," said Kate.</p>

<p>She did not like the plan, but it seemed to
her just then that anything would be better
than telling her mother <ins title="Changed typo 'than' to 'that'">that</ins> she had spilled
the milk; and, wicked as it was, she resolved
to do it.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p>Kate did not think of the poor woman
and her hungry children when she made up
her mind to tell her mother such a monstrous
lie.</p>

<p>She did not think how very wicked it was
to deceive her mother, just to escape, perhaps,
a severe rebuke for her carelessness.</p>

<p>She felt all the time that she was doing
wrong, but she tried so hard to cover it up,
that her conscience was not permitted to do
its whole duty.</p>

<p>When we are tempted to do wrong, something
within us tells us not to do it; but we
often struggle to get rid of this feeling, and
if we succeed the first time, it is easier the
next time. And the more we do wrong, the
easier it becomes to put down the little voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
within us.</p>

<p>It was so with Kate. She had told falsehoods
before, or it would not have been so
easy for her to do it this time. If we do
not take care of our consciences, as we do
of our caps and bonnets, they are soon
spoiled.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice that one of the wheels
on your little wagon, when it becomes loose,
soon wears out? The more it sags over on
one side, the weaker it grows. While the
wheel stands up straight, it does not seem
to wear out at all.</p>

<p>It is just so with your conscience&mdash;your
power to tell right from wrong. While you
keep it up straight, it works well, and never
wears out. But when it gets a little out of
order, it grows worse very fast, and is not
of much more value than a lighthouse without
any light in it.</p>

<p>Kate's conscience had begun to sag over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
on one side. It was growing weak, and did
not remind her of her wrong deeds with
force enough to make itself heeded. If she
could only escape the reproof of her mother,
she did not care.</p>

<p>Thus moved by the wicked counsel of Ben
Tinker, she hastened home. She tried to
look as if nothing had happened, but her
eyes were still very red from crying; and
her mother wanted to know what had made
her cry.</p>

<p>"Fanny Flynn struck me, and pulled my
'shaker' over my face," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"What did she do that for?"</p>

<p>"She asked me to give her a drink of the
milk, and because I wouldn't, she struck
me," answered Kate, placing her pail upon
the kitchen table.</p>

<p>"She is a naughty girl, and I will go and
see her mother about it. What did she say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
to you?"</p>

<p>"She asked me for a drink of the milk."</p>

<p>"What did you answer?"</p>

<p>"I told her it was for Mrs. O'Brien's
children, and that it wouldn't be right for
me to give it to her, and I would not."</p>

<p>"Well, I will see to that. I think it is a
pity if I can't send one of my children out
on an errand of charity without her being
treated in this manner. She shall suffer for
it."</p>

<p>"She is a naughty girl, mother; and I
never mean to speak to her again as long as
I live," said Kate, with much apparent earnestness.</p>

<p>"You did right not to give her any of the
milk, and I am glad you did not. I am
happy that my daughter has been brave
enough to do right, and even to suffer for
doing it. You are a good girl, Kate."</p>

<p>"I meant to be, mother."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did Mrs. O'Brien say when you
gave her the milk?" continued Mrs. Lamb.</p>

<p>"She said she was much obliged to you,"
replied Kate, not daring to look her mother
in the face.</p>

<p>"Did you see the children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb was going to ask more questions
about the family, but something called
her attention away, and Kate was saved
from telling more falsehoods.</p>

<p>She took a book and tried to read, but
she could not, for she did not feel like a
good girl. The little voice within told her
how wicked she had been, and she began to
wish that she had not deceived her mother.</p>

<p>While she sat with the book in her hand,
her father came home; and her mother told
him what Fanny Flynn had done. He was
very angry when he had heard the story, and
asked Kate a great many questions about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
the affair.</p>

<p>"You did well, Kate, and I am glad you
were so brave and so smart," said Mr. Lamb.</p>

<p>"Of course I could not give her any of
the milk when it was for the poor widow's
hungry children."</p>

<p>"You did right, Kate," repeated her
father. "The poor children might have had
to go to bed hungry if you had given up the
milk to that bad girl."</p>

<p>"I know it, father."</p>

<p>"Only think what a sad thing it would
have been if the poor little ones had been
sent hungry and crying to bed. That Fanny
Flynn must be taken care of. When little
girls get to be so bold as that, it is high
time something was done."</p>

<p>"I think so, too, father."</p>

<p>"It is time for you to go to bed now,
Kate," said her mother.</p>

<p>"I am ready, mother, for I am tired as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
can be."</p>

<p>Kate was glad to get away from her father
and mother, for while they were praising
her for her good conduct, she knew very
well that she did not deserve it.</p>

<p>What would her parents think if they
knew that she had spilled all the milk on
the ground? What would they say to her
if they found out that she had told them so
many lies?</p>

<p>The more she thought of her conduct, the
more she felt that she had done wrong. She
now saw that, if she had returned home and
told her mother the truth, she would have
excused the fault, and sent another pail of
milk to the poor sick woman's hungry children.</p>

<p>She wished she had done so, for it would
have been a great deal better to be scolded
for her carelessness than to feel as guilty as
she now felt. She was sure that it was far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
better to suffer a great deal than to do even
a little wrong.</p>

<p>She was not satisfied either that her
mother would have scolded her, if she had
stated the whole truth to her&mdash;that Fanny
Flynn had made her spill the milk.</p>

<p>She went to bed; but when her mother
bade her good night, and took the lamp in
her hand, she begged her to leave it, for she
did not like to be alone in the dark.</p>

<p>It seemed just as though a wicked spirit
was tormenting her; and though she was in
the habit of going to sleep without a light,
the darkness was terrible to her at this time.
She did not even wish to be left alone, but
she dared not ask her mother to stay with
her.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lamb had gone out, Kate
covered her face wholly under the bedclothes,
and shut her eyes as close as she
could, trying in this manner to go to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
But her guilty conscience gave her no rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill-087tn.jpg" width="400" height="370" alt="Kate" title="Kate" />
</div>

<p>Then she opened her eyes, and looked
around the room; but everything in the
chamber seemed to mock and reproach her.
Again and again she shut her eyes, and tried
to sleep.</p>

<p>The little voice within would speak now,
in the silence of her chamber. She had
never felt so bad before; perhaps because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
she had never been so wicked before. Do
you want to know why she suffered so much?
It was because she could not keep from her
mind those hungry, crying children.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>Poor Kate! She had certainly never
been so wicked in her life before. The words
of her father still lingered in her ears, and
she could almost hear the moans of those
hungry, crying children.</p>

<p>She had never been sent to bed in her life
without her supper, and it looked like a
dreadful thing to her&mdash;perhaps even more
dreadful than it really was.</p>

<p>If there had been nothing but the falsehoods
she had told, she might have gone to
sleep; but it was sad to think that she had
deprived the poor children of their supper,
and sent them hungry to bed. This seemed
to be the most wicked part of her conduct.</p>

<p>I do not know how many times she turned
over in the bed, nor how many times she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
pulled the clothes over her eyes to shut out
the sad picture of those hungry and crying
children that would come up before her, in
spite of all she could do to prevent it.</p>

<p>She tried to think of other things&mdash;of the
scene with Fanny; of her school; of a
picnic party she had attended on the first
of May; of almost everything, indeed; but
it did no good. The poor children could not
be banished from her mind.</p>

<p>Kate had been sick with the measles, with
the scarlet fever, and the mumps; and she
remembered how bad she felt at these times;
but it seemed to her now that she would
rather have all these diseases at once than
suffer from a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>When she was sick, her mother bent over
her and pitied her, and did all she could to
ease her pain; and even when she was burning
with fever, and racked with pain, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
felt happier than she did now.</p>

<p>She could not inform her mother how bad
she felt, for that would expose her guilt.
She heard the clock strike nine, and every
moment appeared to her like an hour. Those
poor little children constantly haunted her;
whether her eyes were open or shut, still she
saw them crying, and heard them moaning,
and begging their sick mother to give them
some supper.</p>

<p>O, Kate! how severely was she punished
for the sin she had committed! Her mother
and her father had praised her, but still she
was unhappy.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, the time passed away
and she heard the clock strike ten. She
could endure her sufferings no longer; and
she burst into tears, sobbing and moaning as
if her heart would break.</p>

<p>For some time she cried; but as her distress
increased, she sobbed and moaned so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
loud that her father and mother, who were
in the adjoining room, heard her, and
hastened into the room to <ins title="Changed typo 'and' to 'find'">find</ins> out what
ailed her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my child?"
anxiously asked her mother. "Haven't you
been asleep since you went to bed?"</p>

<p>"No mother," sobbed Kate.</p>

<p>"What ails you? Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"What are you crying for, then?"</p>

<p>"O mother!"</p>

<p>"Why, what ails you, child? Have you
been frightened?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"Tell us what ails you, Kate," added her
father.</p>

<p>Both of her parents were greatly alarmed
about her, for they loved their little girl
very much; and they knew that something
must ail her, or she would not have lain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
awake so long, or have cried so bitterly.</p>

<p>"Can't you tell us what ails you, Kate?"
inquired her mother, very tenderly.</p>

<p>"I have been very naughty, mother," replied
Kate, almost choking with emotion.</p>

<p>"Naughty, child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"I thought you had been very good,"
added Mr. Lamb.</p>

<p>"No, I have not; I have been very wicked,
and you will never forgive me."</p>

<p>"Why, what have you done, Kate? How
strange you act, my child!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it, mother. If you will
forgive me this time, I will never be so
wicked again while I live."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it, Kate, and we will
forgive you," said her father, very kindly.</p>

<p>The poor girl sobbed so that she could not
speak for some time, for the tenderness of
her parents made her feel a great deal worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
than if they had scolded her severely.</p>

<p>"What have you done, Kate?" repeated
Mrs. Lamb.</p>

<p>"I didn't carry the milk to Mrs. O'Brien,
mother," gasped the poor penitent, as she
uncovered her eyes, and looked up in the
face of her parents to notice the effect of her
confession upon them.</p>

<p>"Didn't carry it to her?" was the exclamation
of her father and mother at the
same time.</p>

<p>"No; I spilled it on the ground."</p>

<p>"Why, Kate! what did you do that for?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it&mdash;I mean I was careless.
When Fanny Flynn struck me, I ran
after her. My foot tripped, and I fell, and
spilled all the milk."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me so, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I didn't dare to tell you; I was afraid
you would scold at me, as you did for spoiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
the peony."</p>

<p>Kate felt a little better now that she had
confessed her fault, and she was able to
look her parents in the face.</p>

<p>"Why, Kate, if you had only told me, I
should not have scolded you. You may
have been careless, but it was all the fault
of Fanny Flynn."</p>

<p>"No, mother; I was careless. I forgot
all about the milk, I was so angry."</p>

<p>"And so the poor children had no supper,
after all," added Mr. Lamb.</p>

<p>"O father! It was what you said about
them that made me feel so bad. I am sure
I shall never be so very wicked again. Let
me carry them some milk now."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? It is
after ten o'clock, my child."</p>

<p>"No matter, father; I am not afraid to
go in the dark, if I can only carry them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
their supper."</p>

<p>"No, no, Kate. I will carry them the
milk, though it is rather late, and probably
they are all asleep by this time."</p>

<p>"But will you forgive me, father and
mother?"</p>

<p>"Freely, my child; you have suffered
severely already for your fault, and I hope
it will be a lesson to you which will last as
long as you live," said her father.</p>

<p>"It will," said Kate, earnestly.</p>

<p>Both her parents kissed her, in token of
their forgiveness; and Mr. Lamb put on his
coat, while Mrs. Lamb went to the cellar for
a pail of milk, with which he soon left the
house on his errand of kindness and charity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Kate felt a great deal better then, and
before her father returned, she was fast
asleep. Mr. Lamb found the poor woman
still up. The children had had bread and
water, but no milk, for their supper, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
was very glad to have some for them when
they waked up in the night. And she was
very grateful to Mr. Lamb for thinking of
her at that hour, and thanked God for giving
her such kind and thoughtful friends.</p>

<p>From that time, Kate was a better girl,
and tried hard to reform her life and character.
She tried so hard, and succeeded so
well, that she very soon lost the name of
"Careless Kate."</p>

<p>Mr. Lamb went to see Fanny Flynn's parents
the next day, and they promised to
punish her for her conduct. After that
Kate did not provoke her, and they never
had any more trouble.</p>

<p>Now my readers have seen that Kate's
fault led her into falsehood and deception,
which are worse than carelessness; and I
hope they will all learn to be careful and
truthful.</p>

<h2>DOLLY AND I.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>Do you know what envy means? I hope
you have never felt it, for it is a very wicked
feeling. It is being sorry when another has
any good thing. Perhaps you will know
better what the word means when you have
read my story; and I hope it will help you
to keep the feeling away from your own
heart.</p>

<p>Not far from Mr. Lee's house, in Riverdale,
lived a man by the name of Green. He
was the agent of one of the factories in the
village. Mr. Green had two little girls and
three sons. The boys have nothing to do
with my story, and for that reason I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
not say a great deal about them.</p>

<p>Katy, Mr. Green's older daughter, was
ten years old. She was a pretty good girl,
but she did not like to have others get good
things, when she did not have any herself.
If any person gave one of her brothers an
apple, or an orange, she seemed to think
she ought to have it.</p>

<p>When she was a baby, she used to cry for
everything she saw, and would give her
parents no peace till they gave it to her. I
am sorry to say they were sometimes very
weak on this point, and gave her things
which she ought not to have had, just to
quiet her.</p>

<p>Her father and mother hoped, when she
grew older, she would not want everything
that belonged to her brothers. If Charles
had a plaything, Katy wanted it, and would
cry till she got it. Very often, just to make
her stop crying, her mother made poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
Charley give up the thing.</p>

<p>But as Katy grew older, she seemed to
want everything that others had just as
much as ever. She was now ten years old,
and still she did not like to see others have
anything which she could not have. It is
true she did not always say so, but she felt
it just as much, and was very apt to be cross
and sullen towards those whom she envied.</p>

<p>Nellie Green was not at all like her sister.
She was only eight years old, but there was
not a bit of envy in her. She would give a
part, and often the whole, of her apples,
oranges, candy, and playthings to her sister,
and to her brothers. She liked to see
them happy, and when Charley ate an apple,
it tasted just as good to her as though she
were eating it herself.</p>

<p>She was not selfish. She would always
divide her good things with her friends.
Did you ever see a little boy or a little girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
eating an apple or some candy, and another
little boy or girl standing by, and looking
just as if he wanted some?</p>

<p>Nellie always gave her friends a part,
and then she not only enjoyed what she ate
herself, but she enjoyed what they ate. This
is the way to make apples, oranges, and
candy taste good.</p>

<p>One New Year's Day, Katy's aunt, after
whom she was named, sent her a beautiful
wax doll. It was a very pretty doll, and
the little girl was the happiest child in
Riverdale when the welcome present reached
her.</p>

<p>There was another little girl in Riverdale
who was almost if not quite as happy;
and that was Nellie, her sister. It is true,
the doll was not for her; she did not own
any of it, and Katy would hardly let her
touch it; but for all this, Nellie was pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
to see her sister so happy.</p>

<p>The dolly's name was Lady Jane; for
Katy thought, as she was a very fine doll,
she ought to have a very fine name. So,
when she spoke to the doll,&mdash;and she talked
a great deal with her,&mdash;she always called
her Lady Jane. The two little girls had
five or six other dolls, but none of them were
anything near such fine ladies as Lady Jane.
Their heads were made of porcelain, or rubber,
or composition, and they had grown
so old that they were really ugly.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy, who had a rubber head, looked
as though she "had been through the wars."
Her nose was worn out, so that she had a
great hole in the end of it. I suppose, if
she had wanted to sneeze, this hole would
have been very handy; but Miss Lucy was
a very proper young lady, and never sneezed
in company. If she ever sneezed when alone,
of course there was no one present to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
anything about it.</p>

<p>There was another hole right in the top
of her head, so that if she had had any
brains, they would certainly have leaked
out; but as Miss Lucy was not a strong-minded
woman, I suppose she had no use
for brains.</p>

<p>One of the family of dolls was a little
black girl, whose name was Dinah. She had
seen hard service in her day, and did not
look as though she would last much longer.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny had once been a fine lady, but
times had gone hard with her, and her fine
clothes were both ragged and dirty. But
hard times were not so very bad, for she
wore the same smile as when her clothes
had been new and nice.</p>

<p>Miss Mary was a poor cripple. By a sad
accident she had broken one of her legs.
Katy placed her on a table one day, and
either because the height from the floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
made her dizzy, or because she was laid too
near the edge, she had tumbled off, and
one leg was so badly broken that neither
a wooden nor a cork one could be fastened
in its place.</p>

<p>Therefore Miss Mary could not walk about
the room, and never went anywhere, except
when she was carried. But she was not
half so badly off as Miss Susie, who had
broken her neck, and lost off her head. The
head was tied on with a string, but it kept
falling off while the family were at play;
but Miss Susie did not seem to mind it at
all.</p>

<p>She got along a great deal better without
her head than you or I could without ours.
Indeed, she wore the same smile upon her
face whether the head was on or off&mdash;which
teaches us that we ought always to
be cheerful in misfortune.</p>

<p>Besides these fine young ladies there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
two or three rag babies; but as you could
not tell by the looks of them what they
were thinking about, I will not say anything
about them. They had no virtues
worth telling; they never ate soup with a
fork, or gave money to the poor.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may not think much
of this family of dollies, but I am sure
Katy and Nellie had fine times with them.
They used to spend hours together with
them, and the dollies used to do everything
that anybody could do.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny used to visit a great deal, in
spite of her dirty, ragged clothes; so did
Miss Lucy, with two holes in her head, and
Miss Mary, with her broken leg, and Miss
Susie, with her broken neck. All of them
used to go a-visiting, except Miss Dinah,
and she, being a black girl, had to do the
sweeping and tend the door.</p>

<p>These ladies were all of them so bashful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
that they would not speak in company, and
Katy and <ins title="Changed typo 'Nelie' to 'Nellie'">Nellie</ins> had to do all the talking for
them.</p>

<p>But they used to "make believe" the
dollies talked, and this did just as well.
They used to say just such things as the
ladies did who called on Mrs. Green, and
never left without being urged to stay
longer, and also to call again; which they
always promised to do.</p>

<p>On the whole, they were very wonderful
dollies; at least they were until Lady Jane
came, and she was such a fine lady, with her
white silk dress and her <i>real</i> hair, that none
of them could shine after that.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>


<p>One day Flora Lee came to see Nellie
Green, and to spend the afternoon with her.</p>

<p>It was in the month of November, and
the weather was too cold to permit them to
play in the garden; so they said they would
have a good time in the house.</p>

<p>Katy Green had to go away, and could
not play with them. Nellie was very sorry
for this, for she not only liked to have her
sister with her, but she also wanted the
company of Lady Jane.</p>

<p>She told Flora how sorry she was, and
they agreed that it was too bad Katy had to
go away, for she was older than they, and
could help them a great deal in their plays.
Besides, they wanted one fine lady among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
the dollies, for they had a certain play which
required just such a person.</p>

<p>"I wish I had brought Miss Dolly with
me. I guess she is fine enough," said Flora.</p>

<p>"I wish you had," replied Nellie; "but
as you have not, we can't help it now. I
dare say Miss Fanny will do."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you can do, Nellie."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You can just ask Katy," said Nellie, at
last.</p>

<p>"Why not? She will let you have her.
Of <i>course</i> she will let you have her," added
Flora, warmly.</p>

<p>"I don't think she will. You know we
might break her neck, or lose off her legs
or arms; or we might dirty her white silk
dress."</p>

<p>"But we will be very careful. Let us go
and ask her. It won't do any harm to
ask her, you know. She can't do any more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
than refuse."</p>

<p>Nellie did not like to be refused, and she
tried to prevent Flora from going any
farther in the matter. She was sorry to
have it appear that her sister was selfish,
and she thought more of this than she did of
being refused.</p>

<p>Flora said so much that at last she
thought Katy might let her have the doll,
and they ran downstairs to the sitting room,
to have the matter settled.</p>

<p>"Will you lend us your dolly, Katy?"
asked Nellie, and the tones of her voice
showed how doubtful she was of the result
of the question.</p>

<p>"What dolly do you mean?" asked Katy.</p>

<p>"Your wax dolly&mdash;Lady Jane."</p>

<p>"I am very sure I shall not," replied
Katy.</p>

<p>"We will be very careful of her," added
Flora. "We won't let her be hurt a bit&mdash;you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
may depend on that."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let you have my dolly
to break and spoil&mdash;I'm sure I shall not,"
said Katy, who even seemed to be angry
because she was asked.</p>

<p>"But don't I say we won't hurt it a bit?"
continued Flora. "And when you come
over to my house, you shall have my dolly
just as long as you want her; and her house
too, and all the chairs and tables and
things."</p>

<p>"I don't want them."</p>

<p>"Do please to let us have Lady Jane,"
teased Nellie. "We want her ever so much;
and I know she won't get broken or dirty.
Please to lend her to us, Katy."</p>

<p>"I shan't do any such thing; so it's no
use to tease me. Why don't you play with
your own dollies? I won't lend Lady Jane&mdash;that's
flat."</p>

<p>Nellie felt so bad she could not help crying,&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
because she could not have the
doll, but because her sister was so harsh and
unkind. She would not have cared so much
if Flora had not been there, for she did not
like to have her see her sister behave in this
manner.</p>

<p>Poor Flora wanted to cry, too, when she
saw how badly Nellie felt; but she tried to
be brave, and placed her arm round her
friend's neck, as if to let her know that
she would be kind to her.</p>

<p>"Come, Nellie, let's go upstairs again.
We won't say anything more about it,"
said Flora; and she led her out of the room.</p>

<p>"Now you won't like Katy, after this,"
replied Nellie.</p>

<p>"O, yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Katy would have lent us the dolly, only
Aunt Jane gave it to her, and she is afraid
it will be broken. If it hadn't been for
this, she would have lent us Lady Jane&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
know she would," added Nellie, wiping
away her tears.</p>

<p>"I dare say she would; but we won't
think anything more about it. And when I
come over again, sometime, I will bring her
something, just to show her that I don't
feel hard towards her."</p>

<p>"What a dear, good girl you are, Flora!
I was afraid you would hate her after what
she said."</p>

<p>"O, dear, no, I should hope not. My
mother <ins title="Changed typo 'tell' to 'tells'">tells</ins> me I must love those who don't
do what I want them to; and I try to do so;
but it is very hard sometimes. I wish you
had a wax doll, Nellie. You ought to have
one, you are such a good girl, and love your
sister so much, even when she is not kind to
you."</p>

<p>"I wish I had one; it would be so nice
to have one like Lady Jane. I should be
so happy; but then if only one of us can have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
one, I would rather Katy had it than have
it myself."</p>

<p>"You are not a bit selfish, Nellie. Do
you know what <i>selfish</i> means? I do."</p>

<p>"I guess I do. It means when you have
an apple or any candy to refuse to give a
part to your sister."</p>

<p>"Yes, or to anybody that happens to be
with you. Candy is good, but don't you like
to see others eat it almost as well as you
do to eat it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I think I do."</p>

<p>"Then you know just what I mean, and
I guess we'll play 'visiting' now."</p>

<p>"So we will; and Miss Fanny shall be
the great lady, and Dinah shall be her
servant."</p>

<p>"Yes, and this shall be her house," said
Nellie, as she placed Miss Fanny in a large
arm chair which they were to "make believe"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
was her elegant mansion.</p>

<p>"You shall stay here, and I will bring
Miss Mary to visit Miss Fanny."</p>

<p>Flora bounded over to the other side of
the room, which was supposed to be the
home of the other dolls, and Miss Mary, in
spite of her broken leg, was soon on her
way to visit the fine lady.</p>

<p>"Ting, a ling, a ling!" said Flora, which
meant that the caller had rung the bell, and
Dinah <ins title="Changed typo 'apeared' to 'appeared'">appeared</ins> at the door.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Fanny at home?" asked Flora,
speaking for the lady with the broken leg.</p>

<p>"No, marm, she is not," replied Nellie,
who had to speak for Dinah, because, though
her mouth was very large, she could not
speak for herself.</p>

<p>"What an awful fib!" cried Flora.
"There she is; don't I see her through the
door?"</p>

<p>"But that's just the way some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
fine folks do," replied Nellie, laughing at
Flora's earnestness.</p>

</div>

<p>"It is an awful story, and I wouldn't say
it even in fun."</p>

<p>Nellie said she would not say it again,
only she wanted to have Miss Fanny do just
as the big folks did. And so they played
all the afternoon, though Lady Jane did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
not honor them with her company. All
the dollies paid lots of visits; and Flora
went home.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p>When Flora reached home she told her
mother what a nice time she had, and what
splendid visits Miss Lucy and Miss Mary
and Miss Susie had made to Miss Fanny.</p>

<p>She could not help telling her mother
what a good girl Nellie was, and how she
loved her sister, even when she was unkind
and spoke pettishly to her.</p>

<p>Then she told her how much she wished
Nellie had a wax doll, with real hair, and
a white silk dress. Mrs. Lee thought such a
good girl ought to have one, and the very
next time she went to the city, she bought
the prettiest wax doll she could find for
her.</p>

<p>Flora was full of joy when she saw the
doll, and learned whom it was for. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
a great deal happier than if the doll had
been bought for herself; and she wanted to
run right over to Mr. Green's with the
beautiful present. She longed to see the
eyes of Nellie sparkle as she saw the doll,
and to hear what she would say when told
it was for her. But Mrs. Lee thought they
had better keep the doll till Christmas, and
let her find it with her stocking in the morning.</p>

<p>"But then I shan't see her when she first
gets the dolly," said Flora.</p>

<p>"That is true; but you must write a little
note, which shall be pinned on the doll's
dress."</p>

<p>"That will be splendid, mother! And
I will go right away and write the note
now."</p>

<p>Flora got a pencil and a piece of paper,
and seated herself in the corner. She
worked away for half an hour as busy as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
a bee, and then she carried the note to her
mother. She was not much of a writer,
having been to school only a year. She
could only print the note.</p>

<p>Flora was very fond of writing notes,
and long before she could make a single
letter, she would fill up a piece of paper
with pothooks and spiders' legs, and send
them to her mother and Frank.</p>

<p>She did not spell all the words right, but
her mother told her how to correct them,
and then she printed the note over again,
on a nice sheet of gilt-edged paper. Thinking
my little friends might want to see
this note, I place a copy of it in the book,
just exactly as she wrote it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>When Christmas morning came, Nellie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
found the doll in a chair, close by her stocking.
I can't tell you how pleased she was,
but you can all guess. Then she took the
note from the dress, and read it. She was
more pleased than ever to find it was from
Flora.</p>

<p>She almost cried with joy as she puzzled
out the note, and thought how kind Flora
and her mother were to remember her.</p>

<p>"What a dear you are, Miss Dolly!"
said she, as she took up the doll and kissed
her, just as though she had been a real
live baby. "You and I shall be first-rate
friends, just as long as we live. I will take
such good care of you! Dear me! Why,
mother! Only think!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Nellie?" asked Mrs.
Green, who was almost as much pleased as
her daughter.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?"</p>

<p>"What, child? What do you mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you see those eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see them."</p>

<p>"Why, just as true as I am alive, she
moved them!"</p>

<p>"I think not, my child. She is a very
handsome doll, but I don't think she could
move her eyes, if she tried ever so hard."</p>

<p>"But she did; I know she did;" and
Nellie took hold of her head to examine it
more closely. As she did so, she bent the
body a little. "There! as true as I live,
she moved them again!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green took the doll, and found that
the eyes did really move. It was funny, but
it was true. Mrs. Lee and Flora knew all
about it.</p>

<p>The eyes were made of glass, and there
was something inside of the doll which
moved them when the body was bent.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Katy, who had been
looking on in silence all this time. Nellie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
gave her the doll at once; and she bent the
body and saw the eyes move twenty times.
The happy owner of Miss Dolly waited with
patience till her sister had done with her.</p>

<p>"Why didn't aunt Jane get me one like
that, I wonder," said Katy, when she gave
the doll to Nellie.</p>

<p>"I suppose she could not afford to buy
one like this, for she is not so rich as Mrs.
Lee."</p>

<p>"But you shall have her to play with just
when you want her," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"Pooh! I don't want your old dolly,"
snarled Katy. "She isn't half so good as
mine. I would rather have Lady Jane than
have her, any day."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you wish your aunt
Jane had given you one like this?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"I don't care for her old dolly! She may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
keep it for all me," replied Katy.</p>

<p>"But it shall be yours just as much as
mine, Katy," said Nellie, in tones so gentle
and sweet that her sister ought to have
kissed her for them, and loved her more
than she ever loved her before.</p>

<p>But she did not. She was envious. She
was sorry the doll had been given to Nellie&mdash;sorry
because it was a prettier one than
her own. It was a very wicked feeling.
She had some presents of her own, but her
envy spoiled all the pleasure she might have
taken in them.</p>

<p>Nellie was almost sorry the doll had been
given to her, when she saw how Katy felt
about it. Mrs. Green talked to the envious
girl till she cried, about her conduct. She
tried to make her feel how odious and
wicked envy made her.</p>

<p>Whenever Katy saw the new doll, she
seemed to be angry with her sister. Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
Nellie's pleasure was nearly spoiled, and
she even offered to exchange her doll for
Katy's, but her mother would not let her do
so.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, she seemed to feel
better, and the two sisters had some good
times with their dolls. I say she seemed to
feel better, but she really did not. She did
not like it that Nellie's doll was a finer
one than her own.</p>

<p>Yet Nellie was happier, for she thought
Katy was cured of her ill feeling. Then
she loved her doll more than ever. She was
a cunning little girl, and she thought so
much of her new friend that she always
used to say "Dolly and I."</p>

<p>When her mother asked her where she
had been, she would reply, "Dolly and I
have been having a nice time upstairs."
"Dolly and I" used to do ever so many
things, and no two little ladies could ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
enjoy themselves more than did Dolly and
Nellie.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Katy did not
like Dolly at all. She could never forgive
her for moving her eyes, because Lady Jane
could not move hers. It is true that, after
she saw how silly and wicked her envy made
her appear to others, she tried very hard
not to show it.</p>

<p>We may be just as wicked without showing
our sin to others, as we can be when we
let the world see just what we are. When
we are wicked, the sin is more in the heart
than in the actions.</p>

<p>Men may seem to be very good when
they are really very bad, though people almost
always find out such persons. Katy
was just as wicked, just as envious, when
her sister thought she was kind and loving,
as she was on that Christmas morning, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
the doll was found in the chamber.</p>

<p>You will be surprised and sorry when you
see just how wicked her envy made her.
I shall tell you about it in the next chapter,
and I hope it will lead you to drive any
such feeling from your own hearts.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>Lady Jane and Miss Dolly were kept in
the lower drawer of the bureau, for they
were very fine young ladies, and Mrs.
Green wished to have them kept clean and
nice.</p>

<p>One day, about two weeks after Miss
Dolly was given to Nellie, both she and
Katy had been playing with the dolls.
When the bell rang for tea, they ran downstairs;
but before they went they put the
dolls in the drawer. As they were in a
hurry, they were not very careful, and the
dresses of both the dolls were sadly tumbled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green, who was in the room, saw
in what manner Miss Dolly and Lady Jane
had been thrown into the drawer; and before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
she went down to tea, she took them
both out, smoothed down their dresses, and
put them back in a more proper manner.</p>

<p>Katy and Nellie had had some talk about
their dolls; and the envious girl had said
hers was better than her sister's. Nellie
did not dispute with her about it, but she
saw that Katy had not got over that bad
feeling yet.</p>

<p>The children ate their suppers, and not
a word more was said about the dolls; but
Katy looked very sour. She was thinking
about Miss Dolly's eyes, and wishing Lady
Jane's eyes would move like the other's.</p>

<p>She finished her supper, and ran upstairs
again. By this time it was quite dark in
the room where the dolls were kept, and
Nellie and her mother wondered why she
went upstairs at that late hour.</p>

<p>Katy was still thinking of those eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
She thought her aunt Jane was real mean
not to buy her such a doll; and then she
was very sorry that Flora's mother had
bought it for her sister.</p>

<p>While she was thinking these wicked
thoughts she went to the bureau, and opened
the lower drawer. It was so dark she could
hardly see the dolls, but she took out one of
them.</p>

<p>"Your dolly shall not be better than mine
any longer," said she to herself.</p>

<p>As she said this, she took the scissors
from the work basket on the bureau, and
finding one of the eyes with her fingers,
she struck one of the points right into it.
Then she turned the scissors, so as entirely
to destroy the eye. Not content with this,
she spoiled the other eye in the same manner.</p>

<p>"Now your doll isn't so good as mine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
anyhow," said she to herself, as she put the
poor spoiled lady back into the drawer.</p>

<p>I would not have a little girl feel as she
felt then for all the world. Her heart was
full of envy and wickedness. To gratify
her ill feeling she had thrust the scissors
into the eyes of the doll. She knew how
badly her sister would feel, but she did not
care for this. Now Lady Jane was the best
doll, and she did not care for anything else.</p>

<p>She staid in the room but a few moments.
Closing the drawer, she hastened downstairs,
and took a seat by the fire. She
tried to look as though nothing had happened;
but she was sour and sullen, for she
felt that she had done a very naughty act.</p>

<p>"Come, Katy, let us go upstairs and
play with the dollies again," said Nellie,
when she had got through with her supper.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," replied she, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
even looking at her sister.</p>

<p>"Do come, Katy."</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't want to," snarled she.</p>

<p>"You can bring your dolly downstairs,
and play with her here, Nellie," said her
mother.</p>

<p>"May I, mother?"</p>

<p>"You may&mdash;take a light with you."</p>

<p>"I don't want any light, mother; I can
find her just as well in the dark;" and
away she ran to get the doll.</p>

<p>Don't you think Katy trembled then?
She did tremble, like a leaf, and wished
she had not done the naughty deed. In
a moment Nellie would return with poor
Miss Dolly, whose eyes had been spoiled
with the scissors. She did not think it
would be found out so soon, and she could
not think what to say before the doll came
down.</p>

<p>She felt just as though she should sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
through the floor, when Nellie came into
the room with the doll in her arms. There
would be an awful time in a moment, and
her father and mother would want to know
who had spoiled Miss Dolly's eyes.</p>

<p>They knew she had been upstairs since
tea, and they would charge her with the
naughty act. She meant to deny it, for those
who are wicked enough to do such things
are almost always wicked enough to lie
about them.</p>

<p>"Now won't you and I have a nice time,
Dolly?" said Nellie, as she rushed into the
sitting room, with the doll in her arms,
"Come, Katy, let's play Dolly is the Queen
of England."</p>

<p>"I don't want to play."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;won't you make me a crown for
her?"</p>

<p>"I can't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span></p>

<p>Katy was waiting for her sister to find out
the mischief that had been done, and she
dreaded the moment when she should do so.
She did not dare to look at her, for fear
her looks might betray her.</p>

<p>"You shall be queen without any crown,"
said Nellie, as she placed the doll on the
table. "This pincushion shall be your
throne. There, you look just like a queen&mdash;don't
she, mother?"</p>

<p>"I think she does," replied Mrs. Green,
with a smile. "I hope she will be as good
as Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>"She will, mother&mdash;only she ought to
have a crown."</p>

<p>"I have got a piece of gilt paper upstairs,
and I will make her one. I'm going up in
a minute."</p>

<p>Katy, not daring to look yet, did not
know what to think of this talk. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
could the doll look like a queen when her
eyes had been punched out with the scissors?
It was very strange to her, and she stole a
glance at the queenly Miss Dolly on the
table.</p>

<p>There she was, seated on her pincushion
throne, just as if nothing had happened.
Her eyes were just as bright as ever, and as
Nellie bent her body, she moved them as
well as ever she could.</p>

<p>Katy did not know what to make of it.
She had certainly driven the scissors into
the eyes of the doll as hard as she could; but
there was Miss Dolly as good as new. She
could not explain it, and it was of no use to
try.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green brought down the scissors,
and cut out the crown. Then Miss Dolly
certainly looked like a queen, and Nellie
spent a very pleasant hour with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
majesty, till it was time for her to go to bed.</p>

<p>Katy was very unhappy. She had not
done what she meant to do, and she was
filled with doubt. But she did not have to
wait long to find out what she had done.
When Mrs. Green went upstairs with the
children, Miss Dolly had to be put to bed
first, for she was a queen.</p>

<p>When the bureau drawer was opened,
what do you think they saw? There lay
Lady Jane, with both of her eyes punched
out!</p>

<p>Katy burst into tears when she saw that
her doll was entirely spoiled. Then she
found that she had made a mistake. In the
darkness she had punched out the eyes of
Lady Jane instead of Miss Dolly. This is
the way that wicked people often punish
themselves instead of others.</p>

<p>Her mother had changed the places of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
dolls in the drawer, and this was the reason
why Katy had made the mistake. Don't
you think it served her right?</p>

<p>Katy felt so badly that she could not tell
any of the lies she had made up, and the
truth was found out by her mother. Mrs.
Green scolded her for what she had done,
and for what she meant to do. The naughty
girl cried herself to sleep that night, but
poor Lady Jane was utterly ruined.</p>

<p>Nellie felt almost as bad as her sister, and
said all she could to console her. The next
day Katy was so ashamed of herself that she
did not wish to see anybody. But in a few
days she got over it; and her mother hoped
the affair would do her a great deal of good.
Whenever she showed a spirit of envy, Mrs.
Green reminded her of her doll, and she
tried to conquer the feeling; but it took
many years to cure her.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>Flora Lee's birthday came in July. Her
mother wished very much to celebrate the
occasion in a proper manner. Flora was
a good girl, and her parents were always
glad to do anything they could to please
her, and to increase her happiness.</p>

<p>They were very indulgent parents, and
as they had plenty of money, they could
afford to pay well for a "good time." Yet
they were not weak and silly in their indulgence.
As much as they loved their little
daughter, they did not give her pies and
cakes to eat when they thought such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
articles would hurt her.</p>

<p>They did not let her lie in bed till noon
because they loved her, or permit her to do
anything that would injure her, either in
body or mind. Flora always went to
church, and to the Sunday school, and never
cried to stay at home. If she had cried,
it would have made no difference, for her
father and mother meant to have her do
right, whether she liked it or not.</p>

<p>But Flora gave them very little trouble
about such matters. Her parents knew
best what was good for her, and she was
willing in all things to obey them. It was
for this reason that they were so anxious to
please her, even at the expense of a great
deal of time and money.</p>

<p>The birthday of Flora came on Wednesday,
and school did not keep in the afternoon.
All the children, therefore, could
attend the party which they intended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
give in honor of the day.</p>

<p>About a week before the time, Mrs.
Lee told Flora she might have the party, and
wanted her to make out a list of all the
children whom she wished to invite.</p>

<p>"I want to ask all the children in Riverdale,"
said Flora, promptly.</p>

<p>"Not all, I think," replied Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, all of them."</p>

<p>"But you know there are a great many
bad boys in town. Do you wish to invite
them?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if we treat them well, they
will be made better by it."</p>

<p>"Would you like to have Joe Birch come
to the party?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mother," said Flora,
musing.</p>

<p>"I think you had better invite only those
who will enjoy the party, and who will not
be likely to spoil the pleasure of others. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
will not invite such boys as Joe Birch."</p>

<p>"Just as you think best, dear mother,"
replied Flora. "Shall I ask such boys as
Tommy Woggs?"</p>

<p>"Tommy isn't a bad boy," said Mrs. Lee,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"I don't know that he is; but he is a very
queer fellow. You said I had better not
ask those who would be likely to spoil the
pleasure of others."</p>

<p>"Do you think, my child, Tommy Woggs
will do so?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid he would; he is such a queer
boy."</p>

<p>"But Tommy is a great traveler, you
know," added Mrs. Lee, laughing.</p>

<p>"The boys and girls don't like him, he
pretends to be such a big man. He knows
more than all the rest of the world put together&mdash;at
least, he thinks he does."</p>

<p>"I think you had better ask him, for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
will probably feel slighted if you don't."</p>

<p>"Very well, mother."</p>

<p>"Now, Flora, I will take a pencil and
paper, and write down the names of all the
boys and girls with whom you are acquainted;
and you must be careful not to
forget any. Here comes Frank; he will
help you."</p>

<p>Frank was told about the party, and he
was quite as much pleased with the idea as
his sister had been; and both of them began
to repeat the name of all the boys and girls
they could remember.</p>

<p>For half an hour they were employed in
this manner, and then the list was read
over to them, so as to be sure that no names
had been omitted.</p>

<p>Flora and Frank now went through all
the streets of Riverdale, in imagination,
thinking who lived in each house; and when
they had completed their journey in fancy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
they felt sure they had omitted none.</p>

<p>"But we must invite cousins Sarah and
Henry," said Flora. "O, I hope they will
come! Henry is so funny; we can't do without
them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will come; at any rate
we will send them invitations," replied Mrs.
Lee.</p>

<p>The next day, when the children had gone
to school, Mrs. Lee went to the office of the
Riverdale Gazette, which was the village
newspaper, and had the invitations printed
on nice gilt-edged paper.</p>

<p>By the following day Mrs. Lee had written
in the names of the children invited, enclosed
the notes in envelopes, and directed
them. I will give you a copy of one of them,
that you may know how to write them when
you have a birthday party, though I dare
say it would do just as well if you go to
your friends and ask them to attend. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
you change the names and dates, this note
will answer for any party.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Miss Flora Lee presents her compliments
to Miss Nellie Green, and requests the pleasure

</p>
</div>

<p>"Those are very fine indeed," said Flora:
"shall I put on my bonnet, and carry out
some of them to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, my child; it is not quite the thing
for you to carry your own invitations. I
will tell you what you may do. You may
hire David White to deliver them for you.
You must pay him for it; give him half a
dollar, which will be a good thing for him."</p>

<p>This plan was adopted, and Frank was
sent with the notes and the money over to
the poor widow's cottage.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is very wicked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
mother, for rich folks to have parties, when
the money they cost will do so much good
to the poor?" asked Flora.</p>

<p>"I do not think so, my dear child."</p>

<p>"Well, I think so, mother," added Flora,
warmly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not fully understand
it."</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"Why should it be wicked for you to
enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is wicked to enjoy myself,
but only to spend money for such
things. You said you were going to have
the Riverdale Band, and that the music
would cost more than twenty dollars."</p>

<p>"I did, and the supper will cost at least
twenty more; for I have spoken to the confectioner
to supply us with ice cream, cake,
jellies, and other luxuries. We shall have
a supply of strawberries and cream, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
the nice things of the season. We must
also erect a tent in the garden, in which we
shall have the supper; but after tea I will
tell you all about it."</p>

<h3>II.</h3>


<p>Flora could not help thinking how much
good the forty dollars, which her father
would have to pay for the birthday party,
would do if given to the poor.</p>

<p>It seemed to her just like spending the
money for a few hours' pleasure; and even
if they had a fine time, which she was quite
sure they would have, it would be soon over,
and not do any real good.</p>

<p>Forty dollars was a great deal of money.
It would pay Mrs. White's rent for a whole
year; it would clothe her family, and feed
them nearly all the next winter. It appeared
to her like a shameful waste; and
these thoughts promised to take away a
great deal from the pleasure of the occasion.</p>

<p>"I think, mother, I had just as lief not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
have the band, and only have a supper of
bread and butter and seed cakes."</p>

<p>"Why, Flora, what has got into you?"
said her father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee laughed at the troubled looks of
Flora, and explained to her father the
nature of her scruples in regard to the party.</p>

<p>"Where did the child get this foolish
idea?" asked her father, who thought her
notions were too old and too severe for a
little girl.</p>

<p>"Didn't I see last winter how much good
only a little money would do?" replied
Flora.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is wicked for me to
live in this great house, keep five or six
horses, and nine or ten servants, when I
could live in a little house, like Mrs.
White?" laughed Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>"All the money you spend would take
care of a dozen families of poor folks," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
Flora.</p>

<p>"That is very true. Suppose I should
turn away all the men and women that
work for me,&mdash;those, I mean, who work
about the house and garden,&mdash;and give the
money I spend in luxuries to the poor."</p>

<p>"But what would John and Peter,
Hannah and Bridget do then? They would
lose their places, and not be able to earn
anything. Why, no, father; Peter has a
family; he has got three children, and he
must take care of them."</p>

<p>"Ah, you begin to see it&mdash;do you?" said
Mr. Lee, with a smile. "All that I spend
upon luxury goes into the pockets of the
farmer, mechanic, and laborer."</p>

<p>"I see that, father," replied Flora, looking
as bright as sunshine again; "but all
the money spent on my party will be wasted&mdash;won't
<ins title="Changed typo . to ?">it?"</ins></p>

<p>"Not a cent of it, my child. If I were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
miser, and kept my money in an iron safe,
and lived like a poor man, I should waste
it then."</p>

<p>"But twenty dollars for the Riverdale
Band is a great deal to give for a few hours'
service. It don't do any good, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does; music improves our minds
and hearts. It makes us happy. I have
engaged six men to play. They are
musicians only at such times as they can
get a job. They are shoemakers, also, and
poor men; and the money which I shall pay
them will help support their families and
educate them."</p>

<p>"What a fool I was, father!" exclaimed
Flora.</p>

<p>"O, no; not so bad as that; for a great
many older and wiser persons than yourself
have thought just what you think."</p>

<p>"But the supper, father,&mdash;the ice cream,
the cake, and the lemonade,&mdash;won't all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
money spent for these things be wasted?"</p>

<p>"No more than the money spent for the
music. The confectioner and those whom he
employs depend upon their work for the
means of supporting themselves and their
families."</p>

<p>"So they do, father. And when you
have a party, you are really doing good to
the poor."</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances," replied
Mr. Lee. "I don't think it would be
an act of charity for a person who could not
afford it to give a party. I only mean to
say that when we spend money for that
which does not injure us or anybody else,
what we spend goes into the pockets of
those who need it.</p>

<p>"A party&mdash;a proper party, I mean, such
a one as you will have&mdash;is a good thing in
itself. Innocent amusement is just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
necessary as food and drink.</p>

<p>"God has given me wealth, Flora, and he
expects me to do all the good I can with it.
I hold it as his steward. Now, when I pay
one of these musicians three or four dollars
for an afternoon's work, I do him a favor
as well as you and those whom you invite to
your party.</p>

<p>"And I hope the party will make you love
one another more than ever before. I hope
the music will warm your hearts, and that
the supper will make you happy, and
render you thankful to the Giver of all
things for his constant bounty."</p>

<p>"How funny that I should make such a
blunder!" exclaimed Flora. "I am sure
I shall enjoy my party a great deal more
now that I understand these things."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't understand too much,
Flora. Suppose you had only a dollar, and
that it had been given you to purchase a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
story book. Then, suppose Mrs. White and
her children were suffering from want of
fuel and clothing. What would you do
with your dollar?"</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Flora," interposed her
father. "When you buy the book, you pay
the printer, the paper maker, the bookseller,
the type founder, the miner who dug the
earth, the machinist who made the press,
and a great many other persons whose labor
enters into the making of a book&mdash;you pay
all these men for their labor; you give them
money to help take care of their wives and
children, their fathers and mothers. You
help all these men when you buy a book.
Now, what would you do with your dollar?"</p>

<p>"I would give it to poor Mrs. White,"
promptly replied Flora.</p>

<p>"I think you would do right, for your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
money would do more good in her hands.
The self-denial on your part would do you
good. I only wanted you to understand
that, when you bought a book,&mdash;even a book
which was only to amuse you,&mdash;the money
is not thrown away.</p>

<p>"Riches are given to men for a good purpose;
and they ought to use their wealth for
the benefit of others, as well as for their own
pleasure. If they spend money, even for
things that are of no real use to them, it
helps the poor, for it feeds and clothes
them."</p>

<p>Flora was much interested in this conversation,
and perhaps some of my young
friends will think she was an old head to
care for such things; but I think they can
all understand what was said as well as she
did.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p>The great day at length arrived, and
everything was ready for the party. On
the lawn, by the side of the house, a large
tent had been put up, in which the children
were to have the feast.</p>

<p>Under a large maple tree, near the tent,
a stage for the musicians had been erected.
Two swings had been put up; and there
was no good reason why the children should
not enjoy themselves to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>I think the teachers in the Riverdale
school found it hard work to secure the attention
of their scholars on the forenoon of
that day, for all the boys and girls in the
neighborhood were thinking about the
party.</p>

<p>As early as one o'clock in the afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
the children began to collect at the house of
Mr. Lee, and at the end of an hour all who
had received invitations were present. The
band had arrived, and at a signal from Mr.
Lee the music commenced.</p>

<p>"Now, father, we are all here. What
shall we do?" asked Flora, who was so excited
she did not know which way to turn,
or how to proceed to entertain the party.</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes, and let the children
listen to the music. They seem to enjoy it
very well."</p>

<p>"But we want to play something, father."</p>

<p>"Very soon, my child, we will play something."</p>

<p>"What shall we play, father?"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of plays. Wouldn't
you like to march a little while to the
music?"</p>

<p>"March?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 240px;"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span></p>
<img src="images/ill-195tn.jpg" width="240" height="400" alt="The Swing." title="The Swing." />
<span class="caption">The Swing.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"Yes, march to the tune of 'Hail, Columbia.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
I will show you how to do it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, father."</p>

<p>"Well, I will show you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>When the band had played a little longer,
Mr. Lee assembled the children in the middle
of the lawn, and asked them if they would
like to march.</p>

<p>They were pleased with the idea, though
some of them thought it would be rather
tame amusement for such an exciting occasion.</p>

<p>"You want two leaders, and I think you
had better choose them yourselves. It
would be the most proper to select two
boys."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee thought the choice of the leaders
would amuse them; so he proposed that
they should vote for them.</p>

<p>"How shall we vote, father?" asked
Frank.</p>

<p>"Three of the children must retire, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
pick out four persons; and the two of these
four who get the most votes shall be the
leaders."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee appointed two girls and one boy
to be on this committee; but while he was
doing so, Tommy Woggs said he did not
think this was a good play.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will choose the best
leaders," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Don't you, Mr. Woggs?" asked Mr.
Lee, laughing.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not. What do any of these
boys know about such things!" said
Tommy, with a sneer. "I have been to
New York, and have seen a great many parades."</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have."</p>

<p>"And you think you would make a better
leader than any of the others?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span></p>

<p>All the children laughed heartily at
Master Woggs, who was so very modest!</p>

<p>"None of these boys and girls have ever
been to New York," added Tommy, his
vanity increasing every moment.</p>

<p>"That is very true; and perhaps the
children will select you as their leader."</p>

<p>"They can do as they like. If they want
me, I should be very willing to be their
leader," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>It was very clear that Master Woggs had
a very good opinion of himself. He seemed
to think that the fact of his having been to
New York made a hero of him, and that all
the boys ought to take off their caps to
him.</p>

<p>But it is quite as certain that the Riverdale
children did not think Master Woggs
was a very great man. He thought so much
of himself, that there was no room for others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
to think much of him.</p>

<p>The committee of three returned in a few
minutes, and reported the names of four
boys to be voted for as the leaders. They
were Henry Vernon, Charley Green, David
White, and Tommy Woggs.</p>

<p>The important little gentleman who had
been to New York, was delighted with the
action of the committee. He thought all
the children could see what a very fine leader
he would make, and that all of them would
vote for him.</p>

<p>"What shall we do for votes, father?"
asked Frank.</p>

<p>"We can easily manage that, Frank," replied
Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>"We have no paper here."</p>

<p>"Listen to me a moment, children," continued
Mr. Lee. "There are four boys to
be voted for; and we will choose one leader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
first, and then the other.</p>

<p>"Those who want Henry Vernon for a
leader will put a blade of grass in the hat
which will be the ballot box; those who
want Charley Green will put in a clover
blossom; those who want David White will
put in a maple leaf; and those who want to
vote for Tommy Woggs will put in a&mdash;let
me see&mdash;put in a dandelion flower."</p>

<p>The children laughed, for they thought
the dandelion was just the thing for Master
Woggs, who had been to New York.</p>

<p>One of the boys carried round Mr. Lee's
hat, and it was found that Henry Vernon
had the most votes; so he was declared to
be the first leader.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Tommy Woggs. "What
does Henry Vernon know? He has never
been to New York."</p>

<p>"But he lives in Boston," added Charley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
Green.</p>

<p>"Boston is nothing side of New York."</p>

<p>"I think Boston is a great place," replied
Charley.</p>

<p>"That's because you have never been to
New York," said Master Woggs. "They
will, of course, all vote for me next time. If
they do, I will show them how things are
done in New York."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Charley, as he left
the vain little man.</p>

<p>While all the children were wondering
who would be the other leader, Flora was
electioneering among them for her favorite
candidate; that is, she was asking her
friends to vote for the one she wanted. Who
do you suppose it was? Master Woggs?
No. It was David White.</p>

<p>The hat was passed round again, and
when the votes were counted, there was only
one single dandelion blossom found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
hat.</p>

<p>Tommy Woggs was mad, for he felt that
his companions had slighted him; but it
was only because he was so vain and silly.
People do not often think much of those
who think a great deal of themselves.</p>

<p>There was a great demand for maple
leaves, and David White was chosen the
second leader, and had nearly all the votes.
The boys then gave three cheers for the
leaders, and the lines were formed. Mr.
Lee told Henry and David just how they
were to march, and the band at once began
to play "Hail, Columbia."</p>

<p>The children first marched, two by two,
round the lawn, and then down the center.
When they reached the end, one leader
turned off to the right, and the other to the
left, each followed by a single line of the
children.</p>

<p>Passing round the lawn, they came together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
again on the other side. Then they
formed a great circle, a circle within a circle,
and concluded the march with the "grand
basket."</p>

<p>This was certainly a very simple play, but
the children enjoyed it ever so much&mdash;I
mean all but vain Master Woggs, who was
so greatly displeased because he was not
chosen one of the leaders, that he said there
was no fun at all in the whole thing.</p>

<p>About half an hour was spent in marching,
and then Mr. Lee proposed a second
game. The children wanted to march a
little longer; but there were a great number
of things to be done before night, and so it
was thought best, on the whole, to try a new
game.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>When the children had done marching,
Mrs. Lee took charge of the games. Several
new plays, which none of them had
heard of before, were introduced. The
boys and girls all liked them very well, and
the time passed away most rapidly.</p>

<p>Just before they were going to supper, an
old man, with a fiddle in his hand, tottered
into the garden, and down the lawn. He
was a very queer-looking old man. He had
long white hair, and a long white beard.</p>

<p>He was dressed in old, worn-out, soldier
clothes, in part, and had a sailor's hat upon
his head, so that they could not tell
whether he was a soldier or a sailor.</p>

<p>As he approached the children, they began
to laugh with all their might; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
certainly was a very funny old man. His
long beard and hair, his tattered finery,
and his hobbling walk, would have made
almost any one laugh&mdash;much more a company
of children as full of fun as those who
were attending the birthday party.</p>

<p>"Children," said the old man, as he took
off his hat and made a low bow, "I heard
there was a party here, and I came to play
the fiddle for you. All the boys and girls
like a fiddle, because it is so merry."</p>

<p>"O mother! what did send that old man
here?" cried Flora.</p>

<p>"He came of himself, I suppose," replied
Mrs. Lee, laughing.</p>

<p>"I think it is too bad to laugh at an old
man like him," added Flora.</p>

<p>"It would be, if he were in distress; but
don't you see he is as merry as any of the
children?"</p>

<p>"Play us some tunes," said the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, my little <ins title="Added missing quote">dears;"</ins> and the old man
raised the fiddle. "Let's see&mdash;I will play
'Napoleon's Grand March.'"</p>

<p>The fiddler played, but he behaved so
queerly that the children laughed so loud
they could hardly hear the music.</p>

<p>"Why, that's 'Yankee <ins title="Added missing quote">Doodle,'"</ins> said
Henry Vernon; and they all shouted at the
idea of calling that tune "Napoleon's
Grand March."</p>

<p>"Now I will play you the solo to the
opera of 'La Sonnambula,'" said the old
man.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Henry.</p>

<p>The old man fiddled again, with the same
funny movements as before.</p>

<p>"Why, that's 'Yankee Doodle' too!" exclaimed
Henry.</p>

<p>"I guess he don't know any other tune."</p>

<p>"You like that tune so well, I will play
you 'Washington's March;'" and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
funny old fiddler, with a great flourish,
began to play again; but still it was
"Yankee Doodle."</p>

<p>And so he went on saying he would play
many different tunes, but he played nothing
but "Yankee Doodle."</p>

<p>"Can't you tell us a story now?" asked
Charley Green.</p>

<p>"O, yes, my little man, I can tell you a
story. What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Are you a soldier or a sailor?"</p>

<p>"Neither, my boy."</p>

<p>"The story! the story!" shouted the
boys, very much excited.</p>

<p>"Some years ago I was in New York," the
old man commenced.</p>

<p>"Did you see me there?" demanded
Tommy Woggs.</p>

<p>"Well, my little man, I don't remember
that I saw you."</p>

<p>"O, I was there;" and Tommy thrust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
his hands down to the bottom of his pockets,
and strutted up the space between the children
and the comical old fiddler.</p>

<p>"I did see a very nice-looking little gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was me," pompously added
Tommy.</p>

<p>"He was stalking up Broadway. He
thought everybody was looking at and admiring
him; but such was not the case. He
looked just like&mdash;just like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like me?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Like a sick monkey," replied the fiddler.</p>

<p>"Go on with your story."</p>

<p>"I will, children. Several years ago I
was in New York. It is a great city; if
you don't believe it, ask Master Tommy
Woggs."</p>

<p>"You tell <ins title="Removed duplicate 'the'">the</ins> truth, Mr. Fiddler. It
is a great city, and I have been all over it,
and can speak from observation," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
Master Woggs.</p>

<p>"The story!" shouted the children.</p>

<p>"I was walking up Broadway. This
street is always crowded with people, as well
as with carts and carriages."</p>

<p>"I have seen that street," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Now you keep still a few minutes,
Tommy, if you can," interposed Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"At the corner of Wall Street&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know where that is," exclaimed
Tommy.</p>

<p>"At the corner of Wall Street there was
a man with a kind of cart, loaded with
apples and candy, which he was selling to
the passers by. Suddenly there came a stage
down the street, and ran into the apple
cart."</p>

<p>"I saw the very same thing done," added
Tommy, with his usual self-important air.</p>

<p>"Keep still, Tom Woggs," said Charley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
Green.</p>

<p>"The apples were scattered all over the
sidewalk; yet the man picked up all but one
of them, though he was very angry with the
driver of the stage for running against his
cart."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he pick up the other apple?"
asked Henry.</p>

<p>"A well-dressed man, with big black
whiskers, picked that up. 'Give it to me,'
said the apple man. 'I will not,' replied
the man with whiskers. The apple merchant
was as mad as he could be; and
then the man with black whiskers put his
hand in his pocket and drew out a knife.
The blade was six inches long."</p>

<p>"O, dear me!" exclaimed Flora.</p>

<p>"Raising the knife, he at once moved
towards the angry apple merchant, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" asked several, eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span></p>

<p>"And cut a piece out of the apple, and
put it in his mouth."</p>

<p>The children all laughed heartily, for they
were sure the man with the whiskers was
going to stab the apple merchant.</p>

<p>"He then took two cents from his pocket,
paid for the apple, and went his way," continued
the old man. "Now, there is one
thing more I can do. I want to run a race
with these boys."</p>

<p>"Pooh! You run a race!" sneered
Charley.</p>

<p>"I can beat you."</p>

<p>"Try it, and see."</p>

<p>The old man and Charley took places, and
were to start at the word from Henry. But
when it was given, the fiddler hobbled off,
leaving Charley to follow at his leisure.</p>

<p>When the old man had got half way
round the lawn, Charley started, sure he
could catch him long before he reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
goal. But just as the boy was coming up
with the man, the latter began to run, and
poor Charley found, much to his surprise,
that he ran very fast. He was unable to
overtake him, and consequently lost the race.</p>

<p>The children were much astonished when
they saw the old man run so fast. He appeared
to have grown young all at once.
But he offered to race with any of the boys
again; and half a dozen of them agreed to
run with him.</p>

<p>"I guess I will take my coat off this time,"
said the fiddler.</p>

<p>As he threw away the coat, he slipped off
the wig and false beard he wore; and the
children found, to their surprise, that the
old man was Mr. Lee, who had dressed himself
up in this disguise to please them.</p>

<p>The supper was now ready, and all the
children were invited to the tent. They had
played so hard that all of them had excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
appetites, and the supper was just as
nice as a supper could be.</p>

<p>It was now nearly dark, and the children
had to go home; but all of them declared
the birthday party of Flora was the best
they ever attended.</p>

<p>"Only to think," said Flora, when she
went to bed that night, "the old fiddler was
my father!"</p>
